# Build and publish container images
#
# There are three images in this repo we want to build and publish individually:
# - GISPy
# - ISIS
# - ASP
#
# The images should be tagged as 'latest' and "$VERSION", where the version
# will point unequivocally to a git commit/tag of this repo.
# 'latest' will be the latest version of repository in 'stable' branch.
#
# Reference docs:
