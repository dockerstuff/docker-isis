## GISPy

Besides the packages already provided by this container's base image,
we added a few more we fill useful for most of GIS work in Python.

For a complete listing of the packages installed in the (default) `base`
environment, open a terminal and ask Conda to export `base` profile:

`(Launcher's page) > Other > Terminal`:
```bash
(base) jovyan:~$ conda env export --from-history
```
